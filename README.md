This project aims to replicate the design and functionality of the Netflix app's home page using HTML and CSS. The focus is on creating a visually appealing layout with movie thumbnails, titles, and short summaries. By utilizing HTML for structure and CSS for styling, the goal is to mimic the aesthetic and user experience of the original Netflix interface, providing a familiar browsing experience for users.
